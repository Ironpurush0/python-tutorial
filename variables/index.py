# This is an example of simple variable. Variables are just placeholders which allows you to asign any value to it. 
a = 2
print(a)

# This variable holds a value which is of string type.
variable = "This is a variable."
print(variable)

# These are two different variables that holds two different values where one is a string type and other is int type.
name, age = "Jem", 17
print(name, age)

# This variable holds an array which is known as list in python.
data = [1,2,4,5]
print(data)

# NAMING VARIABLES 
# You can define a single word as a variable name but if your variable name consists more then one word than you can do something like this.

# This approach is called camelCase naming convension where the first letter of the second word should be capital
firstName = "James"
print(firstName)

# Or you can use an underscore. 
# Try not to use any special characters like & or $ as it will not work.
first_name = "John"
print(first_name)


# You can also define the name is all uppercase as these variables are mostly holds a constant value which never changes.
PI = 3.14
print(PI)
